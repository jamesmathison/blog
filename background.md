When I was younger I noticed a certain madness in the world. 

Starting with our food supply (and later, many other things), I learned we now have proven approaches that beat old methods in every way, yet few seemed to notice.

I quit science. It was clear we have a bigger problem implementing what we already know than with discovering more.

The only chance I had to impact the bumbling systems of this world was to first learn how money was made, and learn it well.
