## Me in 3 Paragraphs

Natural philosopher (personality type, = [INTP](http://typelogic.com/intp.html)). I love exploring and inventing systems, and finding truths in the intersections of things that otherwise appear unrelated.

I grew up in London, UK, with the most loving family you could hope for. I visit them when I can, along with my tight clan of grew-up-with mates that live there, who I'm proud to call my "bros".

I'm passionate about food, though I don't have a refined palate or a very healthy diet. I just can't stand the absurdities of our current food production systems. My highest goal in life is to help fix that.
