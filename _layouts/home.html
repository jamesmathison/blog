  <h1>Elevate Your Profits With Heart-Felt Copywriting That Speaks Your Customer’s Language</h1>

    <p><strong>Get the sales your products and services deserve with sales copy that reaches into the core of your market’s desires. </strong></p>

    <p>It’s tough finding and managing a good writer.</p>

    <p><b>Most use “copywriting templates”.</b></p>

    <p>I start every day by studying the most successful sales letters ever written. I write them out by hand, sketch out their structure and make copious notes until the soul of the selling power is drilled into my mind. </p>

    <p><b>Most “love you and leave you”.</b></p>

    <p>I used to be a little guilty of this too (when I was just starting out!). It’s all too easy to do the work, send, and get distracted by the next thing. Now, it’s my personal policy to <b>stick around as the results come in</b>. I check in. I make sure you’re good. Every result that comes in, I want to know about, because it makes me better.</p>

    <p><b>Most use tacky “sales tactics” to get immediate sales while hurting your business.</b></p>

    <p>You deserve someone who understands the flow of business from beginning to end. I know that your lifetime customer value is what boosts revenue the most. So… I get sales without resorting to tactics that hurt your customer relationships (and future profits).</p>

  <h3>You Need A Profitable Control (Not Just A Passable Page)</h3>
    <p>A control is an advertising piece that brings the highest, most solid results of anything else you have. It is used as “the control” to compare new ads or sales pages with. </p>
    <p>With a control, you’re safe. You use those reliable conversions as a baseline, you can work on new ideas to further optimise, or just leave as-is while you work on other parts of your business using the new revenue. That is my goal, every time.</p>

  <h3>Get More Sales With A Personal Touch</h3>
    <p>If necessary (and convenient for you), I will talk with people from your market as part of my research.</p>
    <p>These informal interviews will pull out ideas and phrases that makes your copy sound like it’s reading their mind! </p>
    <p>You should have sales material that feels almost magical. Truly compelling copy is only possible when you understand the person you’re writing to. </p>
