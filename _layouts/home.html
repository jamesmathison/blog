  <h1>I help SaaS companies build their email lists by treating every article like a landing page… </h1>

    <p><b>…because every article <i>is</i> a landing page. </b></p> 
    
&nbsp;
    
    <p>I learned this lesson during my 3 years in the booming startup hub in Cracow, Poland. </p>

    <p>Being the only native-English-copywriter around, I gained access to projects I really had no business being a part of. My experience was lacking, but I had the talent and determination to catch up. </p>

    <p>One day I was leaning over a workstation. A huge paper printout of a complex sales funnel sprawled out in front of me. Sam Cook, the founder and CEO of James Cook Media, was walking me through his creation. </p>

    <p>As he explained the purpose of articles in his funnel, something clicked. </p>

    <p>These articles weren’t to bring people in. We didn’t have the time for SEO to kick in, nor to build up a reputation as a great blog. </p>

    <p>The role these articles played was far more strategic than that, and they were critical for our profit margins. </p>

    <p>They weren't a mere "blog".</p>

    <p><i><b>They were an army of landing pages. </b></i></p>

    <p>Even if someone read an article and bounced, we could remarket to them, tailoring our messages to the interest they expressed by reading our article. </p>

    <p>After working with Sam, this insight has continued to develop in my mind and work. </p>

    <p>Now, I’m here to tell you… </p>

    <p>Get off the content “hamster wheel”. Stop “spraying and praying”. Every article should make you money and you should know how much. </p>
    
    <p>When an article is truly excellent, it can be the source of countless more pieces of content and promotional pieces. It can be repurposed and spread across the internet on every platform. It can tell you what’s going on in the minds of its readers. </p>

    <p>And, of course, it can grow your email list. </p>

    <p>It <i>must</i> grow your email list. </p>

    <p>Every one of your articles is a landing page at the bottom of a little funnel, whether you know it or not. All that remains is how intentional and well-built that funnel is. </p>
