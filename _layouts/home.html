  <h1>Elevate Your Profits With Heart-Felt Copywriting That Speaks Your Customer’s Language</h1>

    <p><b>Get the sales your products and services deserve with sales copy that reaches into the core of your market’s desires. </b></p> 
    
&nbsp;
    
    <p>It’s tough finding and managing a good writer.</p>

    <p><b>Most use “copywriting templates”.</b></p>

    <p>I start every day by studying the most successful sales letters ever written. I write them out by hand, sketch out their structure and make copious notes until the soul of the selling power is drilled into my mind. </p>

    <p><b>Most “love you and leave you”.</b></p>

    <p>I used to be a little guilty of this too (when I was just starting out!). It’s all too easy to do the work, send, and get distracted by the next thing. Now, it’s my personal policy to <b>stick around as the results come in</b>. I check in. I make sure you’re good. Every result that comes in, I want to know about, because it makes me better.</p>

    <p>Most use tacky “sales tactics” to get immediate sales while hurting your business.</p>

    <p>You deserve someone who understands the flow of business from beginning to end. I know that your lifetime customer value is what boosts revenue the most. So… I get sales without resorting to tactics that hurt your customer relationships (and future profits).</p>

  <h3>You Need A Profitable Control (Not Just A Passable Page)</h3>
    <p>A control is an advertising piece that brings the highest, most solid results of anything else you have. It is used as “the control” to compare new ads or sales pages with. </p>

    &nbsp;
    
    <h3>2. Optimise Your Results By Demanding Everything Be Tested</h3>
        <p>Building you a control means I stick around as your results roll in. I care deeply about how your copy performs, and I’ll stand beside you as you watch your conversion rates play out. Everything I create needs to prove itself against the market. That’s why you’ll get split test ideas for key pieces of writing, unprompted, at no extra charge. That’s just how I like to work. </p>

    &nbsp;
    
    <h3>3. Base Your Material On Deep Psychographic Research</h3>
        <p>It’s easy to base customer research on demographics (age, place of residents, number of cats, etc). Demographic traits, however, only help because sometimes they overlap with psychographic traits (how you think and feel about certain things). Your copy should be built on insights pulled from the market’s inner world, not their external situation. That’s the only way to create material that hits them deep. </p>

    &nbsp;
    
    <h3>4. Apply The Personal Touch: Dig Into Market Psychology With Interviews</h3>
        <p>If necessary (and convenient for you), I will meet or talk with people from your target market. These informal interviews will pull out ideas and phrases that makes your copy sound like it’s reading their mind! </p>

    &nbsp;
    
    <h3>5. Structure Your Copy On Principles Pulled From The Best Sales Letters Of All Time</h3>
        <p>Your copywriter should be one who trains daily by hand-writing and dissecting the most profitable sales letters in history. In addition to this, I continuously study books written by legendary copywriters of the past. Your copy won’t be swayed by fashionable “trends” based on the untested opinions that knock around the ad-man echo-chamber. Your copy will be crafted from time-tested principles learned from the very best copywriters of the last century. </p>

    &nbsp;
    
    <h3>6. Keep Your Business’s Future Success In Mind At All Times</h3>
        <p>By seeing keeping the whole sales funnel in mind, I’ll write your copy in a way that boosts short-term sales as well as protect long-term profits. Pushing too hard or using tacky sales tactics will hurt lifetime customer value. When you convert a customer, you deserve that customer to stay a happy source of revenue for many years to come. You get that kind of loyalty by leaving them feeling satisfied (and, even more importantly, respected) after every transaction. </p>
