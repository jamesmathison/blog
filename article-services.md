You need a writer with an eye on the numbers. 

Marketers are blogging 800% more than 5 years ago, yet they’re getting 89% less shares! (Source: [AMA](https://www.ama.org/publications/eNewsletters/MarketingInsightsNewsletter/Pages/marketers-blogging-800-percent-more-getting-nearly-100-percent-fewer-shares.aspx))

It you read most “official business blogs”, you understand why. They’re uninspiring. They’re stuck in the past, when just having a blog was enough to get attention. 

If you follow their lead, your blog will pump out post after post that collects nothing but digi-dust. 

Instead, why not create articles that collect leads? 

## Charge Your Content With a Devoted Wordsmith
Blogging is no longer child’s-play. It’s a serious business that impacts your bottom line, either by adding names to your customer list or by being a money-sink. 

Whether you go with me or someone else, your writer must understand the strategy and the key metrics of the blog – namely, how many people are signing up to your email list through the articles. That number needs to be rising constantly, or there’s a problem. 

You need a devoted wordsmith who invests himself in the real-world results of his work, who knows how to reach into a reader’s mind and tug them through his paragraphs, and who knows the crucialness of punctuality. 

In short, you need a professional. 

## Take Your Blog Off Your To Do List
Content is important, but let’s face it, you’ve got even more critical (and much more urgent) things to do with your time. 

You may have tried blogging before, and found it tough, tedious, and seemingly random. “Did that last article work? What does it really mean for an article to ‘work’?”

You don’t have the time for another full-time job, or to learn the art and science to blogging on top of everything else you have to do! 

With a devoted wordsmith in your corner, you can lift the big mess of “blogging” off your plate and dump it onto his. Then watch in transform from a mess into a well oiled machine that starts bringing in results for your business.
